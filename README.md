# DNA Visualization

Delve into the intricate world of life's blueprint with the DNA Visualization program. This engaging program offers a dynamic and visual representation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the fundamental molecule that carries the genetic information in every cell of our bodies. Experience the awe-inspiring double helix structure and the base pairs of guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine come to life through simple yet captivating ASCII art.

## How to Experience

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Observe as the program creates a dynamic image of the DNA double helix.
3. Marvel at the elegance of the spiral staircase structure and the representation of base pairs.

## Features

- Visualize the iconic double helix structure of DNA.
- Appreciate the beauty of simple ASCII art representing nucleotide base pairs.
- Experience a dynamic representation of life's blueprint at a molecular level.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python dna_visualization.py`.
4. Witness the DNA double helix come to life as it is dynamically generated.
